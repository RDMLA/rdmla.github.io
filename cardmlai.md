<h4><b>Overview</b></h4>

The **“RDMLA: AI for Librarians”** is being offered as an extension of The Research Data Management Academy (RDMLA), with a timely focus on developing and advancing AI literacy/competency for librarians. The curriculum is currently under development with units such as "AI Tools for Library Research," "AI Use Cases," and "AI Ethics" in progress. The first two units will address how to use specific generative AI tools in the LIS setting and what scenarios are most appropriate to use AI in library and information science practice, respectively. The “AI Ethics” unit will present ethical framework(s) and discuss common ethical concerns (environmental impact, bias, labor issues, academic integrity, etc.).The three units are expected to be available online in Fall 2025. Additional units may be developed in the future. All "RDMLA: AI for Librarians" units will be hosted online on Canvas under CC-BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike) licensing.
