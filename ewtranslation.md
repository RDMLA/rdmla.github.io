Based on a shared purpose of providing better access to quality, open educational materials to broader learning communities, the RDMLA team collaborated with the National Taiwan University (NTU) Library in early 2020 to develop the <a href="https://www.canvas.net/browse/simmonsu/courses/research-data-management-librarian-academy-rdmla--" target="_blank">Chinese version of the RDMLA</a>. 

The translation effort was initiated by a joint meeting in February 2020, to discuss work expectations, capabilities, responsibilities, and timeline. Through a collaborative approach involving an iterative review, a deliberate attempt was made to ensure that the translation retains the authenticity and integrity of the original content.

During the post-translation joint meeting, the RDMLA review team and the NTU translation team discuss issues occurring in the translation and reach an agreement for the best practices in translation. Given the expectation that the translated course will be usable by all Chinese speaking learners, including in Taiwan and other areas that use traditional fonts, and in Mainland China, which uses simplified Chinese, both teams agreed to include a glossary table at the beginning of each unit to list frequently used terms.

The Chinese version of RDMLA consists of all eleven units, focusing on the knowledge and skills needed to collaborate with researchers and other stakeholders on data management.

**The RDMLA Spanish Version course has officially launched and is now available for registration and access!**  
The translation of RDMLA into Spanish will make the RDMLA content accessible to approximately 600 million Spanish-speaking learners around the world. This project is the result of a partnership between a team of lecturers from the Department of History of Science and Documentation and members of the research group at the Health and Social Research and Information Unit (UISYS) at the Universitat de València (Spain). In September 2024, RDMLA established its official partnership with the Universitat de València and began working on a Spanish language version of RDMLA.The units that have been translated come directly from the eleven original RDMLA units. You may take the units in sequence or out of order. All of the content is freely available and open for reuse under the CC-BY-NC-SA licensing.
