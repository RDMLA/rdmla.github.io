Interested parties **need** to:
1. Have completed all eight units in the course
2. Pay the $50 USD CE administrative fee

The test comprises of 25 questions based on the materials discussed in the first eight course units. Students will have 90 minutes to complete the test. 

Test takers will have two attempts, per paid fee, to pass the test. To pass, learners need to receive a 75% or higher. Those who successfully pass the test will receive a certificate from Simmons SLIS recognizing their three (3) continuing education credits in the subject of research data management.

For those students who earn the three CE credits from SLIS will receive their certificate via email 48 to 72 hours after their test.

We wish you the best of luck as you pursue the CE credits and in your future RDM endeavors!

**CE UPDATE:** In Summer 2021, the RDMLA will be expanding their optional CE test offerings! More information will be available soon.
