#### What is the RDMLA?

The Research Data Management Academy (RDMLA) is a global, free online professional development program for librarians, information professionals, or other professionals who work in a research-intensive environment. The curriculum focuses on the knowledge and skills needed to collaborate with researchers and other stakeholders on data management. RDMLA features a unique partnership between a library and information science academic program, six academic health sciences and research libraries, and one publisher. All of the content is hosted on Canvas Network, freely available, and open for reuse under a **CC-BY-NC-SA** license.

#### What is research data management and why is it important for librarians?

Research data is anything collected or generated in the process of research. And research data management is the management of any data you use or generate during a research project. Research data management (RDM) operates on the intersections of data, information, and library sciences.

RDMLA is essential to gain efficiencies, meet growing RDM needs, and address the librarian skills gap. Units are created to address the transparent need librarians, information professionals, and researchers have to equip themselves with tools to be able to know the basic foundations of good data management practices.

#### How did RDMLA determine librarians RDM training/skill needs?

Between May and September 2018, the RDMLA Survey was distributed to relevant groups via email, a Library Connect blog post, listservs, and word of mouth. The 19 question survey gauged general perceptions, particularly from librarians worldwide, about RDM and RDM training.

#### What's new for the RDMLA?

***May 2021***: In response to the acceleration of emerging RDM topics, the RDMLA team will begin introducing mini-modules - brief video lectures with open-access readings - that discuss trending and timely topics. The first mini-module, due to launch in July 2021, is being developed through new partnerships with the NIH and IUPUI, and will focus on the upcoming NIH policy for data management and sharing. Other topics under consideration include pre-prints, open access archives, and data and social justice.
