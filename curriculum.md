<h4><b>RDMLA Mini-Modules</b></h4>

In July 2021, the RDMLA began to offer RDM trending topics mini-modules. Mini-Modules feature short video lectures with corresponding open-source resources that examine subject areas and emerging topics of research data management. 

Mini-modules are different from their full unit counterparts in that they only consist of an approximately one-hour long video lecture on specific topics and do not typically include the learning activities, tests, case studies, or completion certification that regular units offer.
<br>

  - NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing
  - Research Data Ethics in Health Sciences
  - RDM in the Canadian Context
  - Research Methods <br>
